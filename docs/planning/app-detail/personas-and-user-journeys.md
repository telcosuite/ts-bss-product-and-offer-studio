# Product And Offer Studio App Personas And User Journeys

Reviewed: 2026-06-06

This document describes how different personas should experience the app and how the app should support real operational journeys. Use it when designing screens, workflow tasks, API commands, notifications, reporting, and permissions.

Source overview: [product-and-offer-studio.md](../product-and-offer-studio.md)

## Personas Covered

- Product manager: defines offers, bundles, eligibility, lifecycle, and launch plans.
- Pricing manager: owns recurring, usage, one-time, penalty, device, discount, and promotional price structures.
- Commercial operations user: governs release windows, approvals, and channel publication.
- Catalog governance user: checks product-to-service/resource realization and launch readiness.

## Journey Design Principles

- Start journeys from real work triggers: customer contact, partner request, order fallout, alarm, planning threshold, approval queue, compliance event, API error, or scheduled operational review.
- Keep every journey API-backed so the same capability can be exposed through internal UI, self-care, partner portal, automation, or headless integration.
- Show users the source of truth, related projections, and confidence level where data is derived from another app.
- Design every journey with exception handling, audit evidence, notification, and downstream event behavior.
- Avoid making digital or reporting views accidental masters of BSS, OSS, revenue, inventory, or security records.

## Core Workflow Journey

| Step | User intent | App responsibilities | Output |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Define product specifications, offerings, bundles, and categories. | App validates context, permissions, dependencies, and lifecycle state. | App-owned record, event, task, projection, or handoff is updated. |
| 2 | Define pricing, promotions, discounts, and approval rules. | App validates context, permissions, dependencies, and lifecycle state. | App-owned record, event, task, projection, or handoff is updated. |
| 3 | Define configurable options, compatibility, defaults, and guided-selling constraints. | App validates context, permissions, dependencies, and lifecycle state. | App-owned record, event, task, projection, or handoff is updated. |
| 4 | Attach agreements, contract terms, commitments, penalties, renewals, and entitlements. | App validates context, permissions, dependencies, and lifecycle state. | App-owned record, event, task, projection, or handoff is updated. |
| 5 | Validate catalog readiness against service/resource design, fulfillment, billing, campaign, and channels. | App validates context, permissions, dependencies, and lifecycle state. | App-owned record, event, task, projection, or handoff is updated. |
| 6 | Publish versioned offers to CPQ, digital commerce, partner marketplace, billing, and fulfillment. | App validates context, permissions, dependencies, and lifecycle state. | App-owned record, event, task, projection, or handoff is updated. |

## Persona Journeys

## Persona Journey 1: Product manager

Need: defines offers, bundles, eligibility, lifecycle, and launch plans.

Typical journey:

1. Opens the app from a work queue, customer/account context, operational dashboard, external notification, or direct search.
2. Reviews relevant records, relationships, history, policy flags, and open exceptions across modules such as Product Catalog, Pricing, Promotion, And Discount, Product Configuration, Agreement And Contract.
3. Performs the required domain action through the owning app workflow, API-backed form, task, approval, or automation.
4. Handles validation errors, missing dependencies, policy exceptions, or fallout by assigning work, requesting correction, escalating, or creating a linked case/task.
5. Confirms the outcome, captures evidence, triggers notifications/events, and leaves downstream apps with a reliable status to consume.

Success measures:

- The persona can complete work without switching to hidden spreadsheets or direct database access.
- The app records who changed what, why, from which channel, and what downstream dependency was affected.
- The journey creates an API/event trail that supports operations, customer visibility, analytics, and audit.

## Persona Journey 2: Pricing manager

Need: owns recurring, usage, one-time, penalty, device, discount, and promotional price structures.

Typical journey:

1. Opens the app from a work queue, customer/account context, operational dashboard, external notification, or direct search.
2. Reviews relevant records, relationships, history, policy flags, and open exceptions across modules such as Product Catalog, Pricing, Promotion, And Discount, Product Configuration, Agreement And Contract.
3. Performs the required domain action through the owning app workflow, API-backed form, task, approval, or automation.
4. Handles validation errors, missing dependencies, policy exceptions, or fallout by assigning work, requesting correction, escalating, or creating a linked case/task.
5. Confirms the outcome, captures evidence, triggers notifications/events, and leaves downstream apps with a reliable status to consume.

Success measures:

- The persona can complete work without switching to hidden spreadsheets or direct database access.
- The app records who changed what, why, from which channel, and what downstream dependency was affected.
- The journey creates an API/event trail that supports operations, customer visibility, analytics, and audit.

## Persona Journey 3: Commercial operations user

Need: governs release windows, approvals, and channel publication.

Typical journey:

1. Opens the app from a work queue, customer/account context, operational dashboard, external notification, or direct search.
2. Reviews relevant records, relationships, history, policy flags, and open exceptions across modules such as Product Catalog, Pricing, Promotion, And Discount, Product Configuration, Agreement And Contract.
3. Performs the required domain action through the owning app workflow, API-backed form, task, approval, or automation.
4. Handles validation errors, missing dependencies, policy exceptions, or fallout by assigning work, requesting correction, escalating, or creating a linked case/task.

## Cross-Module Journeys

The app should support journeys that cross these modules: Product Catalog, Pricing, Promotion, And Discount, Product Configuration, Agreement And Contract, Catalog Governance.

| Journey type | Description | Required app behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Happy path completion | The user has valid context, required permissions, complete source data, and no blocking dependency. | Guide the user through the shortest path, validate silently where possible, publish events, and show clear completion state. |
| Exception and fallout | Data is missing, validation fails, downstream app is unavailable, or policy requires review. | Preserve the attempted action, create an actionable exception, assign ownership, support retry/resume, and notify affected journeys. |
| Assisted correction | A consumer detects wrong or stale master data. | Route correction to the owning module, capture evidence, prevent local shadow fixes, and publish corrected state. |
| Supervisor review | A lead needs aging, volume, SLA, fallout, risk, or productivity visibility. | Provide dashboards, saved filters, bulk assignment, escalation, and exportable evidence without exposing direct database access. |
| Compliance and audit | A compliance or audit user needs proof of policy adherence. | Show decision history, access history, before/after values, approvals, retention/legal hold status, and evidence links. |
| API consumer journey | Another app, partner, channel, or automation uses this app headlessly. | Provide documented APIs, events, idempotency, correlation IDs, clear error models, version compatibility, and conformance tests. |

## Screen And Task Implications

- Provide landing views by persona: personal work queue, operational dashboard, search, recent records, exceptions, and approvals.
- Provide record detail views with lifecycle state, relationships, timeline, evidence, comments, tasks, and related external references.
- Provide guided actions for create, update, approve, reject, cancel, suspend, resume, retry, handoff, export, and close where relevant.
- Provide role-aware views so sensitive customer, revenue, security, partner, and network data is masked or restricted by policy.
- Provide journey telemetry so product owners can see drop-off, rework, exception causes, automation success, and user effort.

## Journey Completion Definition

A journey is complete only when:

1. The owning app record reaches a valid lifecycle state.
2. Required events, notifications, and downstream handoffs are sent or queued.
3. Audit evidence is stored with actor, source, reason, and correlation ID.
4. Linked apps can consume the outcome through APIs, events, or governed projections.
5. Operational dashboards and reports can explain the status without direct database inspection.
